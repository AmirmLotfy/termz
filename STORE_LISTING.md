## Detailed Description

### Overview

Termz is an AI-powered Chrome extension that automatically analyzes legal documents as you browse the web. It detects risks, translates legal jargon into plain language, and helps you understand what you're agreeing to—all processed locally on your device using Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano).

### The Problem

Every day, we accept terms and conditions without understanding them. Legal documents use complex jargon that's difficult to parse, yet we encounter privacy policies, terms of service, and legal agreements constantly across the web. This puts us at risk of:
- Unfair privacy practices
- Hidden liability waivers
- Binding arbitration clauses
- Auto-renewal traps
- Unexpected data sharing

### The Solution

Termz automatically detects when you visit a legal document page and provides instant, comprehensive analysis:
- **Risk Detection**: Identifies concerning clauses and assigns risk scores
- **Plain Language**: Translates legal jargon into everyday English
- **Smart Summaries**: Provides executive summaries and key points
- **Interactive Glossary**: Defines legal terms in simple language
